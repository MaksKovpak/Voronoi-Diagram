# Voronoi diagram 
My implementation of the [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). Points are generated randomly. By clicking on any point, it is highlighted and you can move it around the screen. You can also add new points with the left mouse button while holding down the LeftAlt key. Note that the maximum number of points is 512, but you can increase this number in the code
